    "text": "In 2018, Northwestern football completed the impossible. The nerds from Evanston won the Big Ten West and became the first team not named Wisconsin or Iowa to represent the division in the conference championship game, since the West (and East) division was established in 2014. From a statistical perspective, however, the 2018 rendition of the Wildcats appeared to be quite bad, finishing with the third-worst offensive yards per play and right below the middle of the pack when it comes to defensive yards given up per play in the Big Ten.  \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nBigTenWest18v2 &lt;- read_csv(\"BigTenWest18v2.csv\")\nBigTenWest18Ydsv2 &lt;- read_csv(\"BigTenWest18Ydsv2.csv\")\nNorthwesternWinScoreDiff &lt;- read_csv(\"NorthwesternWinScoreDiff.csv\")\n\nBigTenWest18Ydsv2 |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalPlays = sum(OffPlays), \n    TotalYards = sum(OffYds), \n    DefensivePlays = sum(DefPlays), \n    DefensiveYards = sum(DefYds)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    OffensiveYPP = TotalYards/TotalPlays, \n    DefensiveYPP = DefensiveYards/DefensivePlays) -&gt; ypp\n\naverages &lt;- ypp |&gt; ungroup() |&gt; summarise(AvgOffYardsPer = mean(OffensiveYPP), AvgDefYardsPer = mean(DefensiveYPP))\n\nwest_teams &lt;- c(\"Northwestern\", \"Illinois\", \"Iowa\", \"Minnesota\", \"Nebraska\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Purdue\")\n\nwest &lt;- ypp |&gt; filter(Team %in% west_teams)\n\neast_teams &lt;- c(\"Ohio State\", \"Indiana\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan State\", \"Penn State\", \"Maryland\", \"Rutgers\")\n\neast &lt;- ypp |&gt; filter(Team %in% east_teams)\n\nteam_colors &lt;- c(\"Illinois\" = \"#E84A27\", \"Iowa\" = \"#FFCD00\", \"Minnesota\" = \"#7A0019\", \"Nebraska\" = \"#E41C38\", \"Northwestern\" = \"#4E2A84\", \"Purdue\" = \"#CEB888\", \"Wisconsin\" = \"#C5050C\")\n\n ggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=east, aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP), color=\"light grey\", size = 1.4) +\n  geom_point(data=west, aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=5.524939, color=\"dark grey\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept=5.726772, color=\"dark grey\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=6.25, y=5, label=\"Good Offense, Good Defense\"), color=\"#151515\", size = 2.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=4.75, y=5, label=\"Bad Offense, Good Defense\"), color=\"#151515\", size = 2.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=4.75, y=6.5, label=\"Bad Defense, Bad Offense\"), color=\"#151515\", size = 2.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=6.25, y=6.5, label=\"Bad Defense, Good Offense\"), color=\"#151515\", size = 2.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=west, aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label=Team, color=Team)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=east, aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label=Team, color=Team), size = 2.8) +\n  labs(x=\"Average Offensive Yards Per Play\", y=\"Average Defensive Yards Per Play\", title=\"Nothing to Write Home About Statistically...\", subtitle=\"Despite the title of Big Ten West divison champions, Northwestern ranked near the bottom\\nin offensive yards per play and sported a sub-par defense.\", caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Tyler Hurst\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = team_colors) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 7),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 6),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how did Northwestern win the division over multiple teams that ranked statistically better on both offense and defense? The Wildcats won when it mattered. Northwestern finished the season on a 7-1 record (their one loss to No. 3 Notre Dame), which included an undefeated 6-0 record against every divisional foe (outside of their win against Purdue that was played week one). \n\n\nCode\nnorthwestern_data &lt;- BigTenWest18v2 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Northwestern\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=BigTenWest18v2, aes(x=Game, y=Wins, color=Team), alpha=.6) +\n  geom_point(data=BigTenWest18v2, aes(x=Game, y=Wins, color=Team), size = 3, alpha=.3) +\n  geom_point(data=northwestern_data, aes(x=Game, y=Wins, color=Team), size = 4) +\n  geom_bump(data=northwestern_data, aes(x=Game, y=Wins, color=Team), size = 1) +\n scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#E84A27\", \"#FFCD00\", \"#7A0019\", \"#E41C38\", \"#4E2A84\", \"#CEB888\", \"#C5050C\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2,4,6,8,10,12)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"How The West Was Won\",\n    subtitle = \"Northwestern football prevailed after a 1-3 start in 2018, closing the\\nseason on a 7-1 record.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Tyler Hurst\"\n  ) & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nMore specifically, the Wildcats were able to win one-possession games. When the mean score differential is calculated for the eight regular season wins for Northwestern in 2018, they won each game by an average of seven points. They only had three regular season wins in double digits, the most being by 14 points against No. 20 ranked Wisconsin at the time.  \n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=NorthwesternWinScoreDiff,\n    aes(y=reorder(Opponent, ScoreDiff), x=TeamPts, xend=OppPts),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Squeaking Out Wins\",\n    subtitle = \"The longer the line, the more points Northwestern won by in the regular season.\",\n    x = \"Points Scored (Red = Opponent, Green = Northwestern)\",\n    y = \"Opponent\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Tyler Hurst\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the 2018 Northwestern Wildcats should be remembered as a gritty squad that was nothing statistically significant, but was able to win games when it mattered. Even though they could not bring home the Big Ten Championship against No. 6 Ohio State, they finished the year on a 31-20 victory over No. 20 Utah in the Holiday Bowl, cementing one of the most successful seasons in program history."

    "section": "",
    "text": "For those looking for the short answer, pure mediocrity was why a playoff berth for the Lincoln Saltdogs fell short. But for those interested in the mediocrity lore, let’s take a closer look. The 2023 campaign for the Lincoln Saltdogs began with an abysmal 7-15 start through the first four weeks of play, placing the ’Dogs dead last in the American Association West Division. After a promising spark of winning throughout the month of July, Lincoln climbed their way from sixth to second in the West division, meaning all they would need to do is be average at minimum to secure a playoff spot. This, however, was not the case as the Saltdogs would fall right back to where they started the year, near the basement floor of the American Association West Division.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\nallteams &lt;- tibble()\n\nSaltdogsSchedule &lt;- read_csv(\"SaltdogsSchedule.csv\")\nAAScheduleWest &lt;- read_csv(\"AmericanAssociationScheduleWest.csv\")\nSaltdogsScheduleV2 &lt;- read_csv(\"SaltdogsScheduleV2.csv\")\nAATeamPitching23 &lt;- read_csv(\"AATeamPitching23.csv\")\nAATeamPitchingV2 &lt;- read_csv(\"AATeamPitchingV2.csv\")\nAATeamBatting23 &lt;- read_csv(\"AATeamBatting23.csv\")\nSaltdogsSchedule &lt;- read_csv(\"SaltdogsSchedule.csv\")\nAATeamPitchingV2 &lt;- read_csv(\"AATeamPitchingV2.csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=AAScheduleWest, aes(x=Game, y=WinTotal, color=Team), size = 0.75, alpha=.18) +\n  geom_point(data=AAScheduleWest, aes(x=Game, y=WinTotal, color=Team), size = 1, alpha=.18) +\n  geom_point(data=SaltdogsSchedule, aes(x=Game, y=WinTotal, color=Team), size = 1.5) +\n  geom_bump(data=SaltdogsSchedule, aes(x=Game, y=WinTotal, color=Team), size = 1.5) +\n scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#000000\", \"#faeeb8\", \"#b7a10d\", \"#9d282a\", \"#005dab\",\"#d22030\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,100)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"A Climb to Disappointment\",\n    subtitle = \"Despite sitting at second in the West division at game 71, Lincoln\",\n    caption = \"Source: pointstreak.com | By Tyler Hurst\"\n  ) & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the data presented, one may assume Lincoln lost to more challenging teams toward the start of the year, won against easier foes during the middle portion and again faced and lost to more challenging teams during the last stretch of the season. Statistically, this would be disproven, as the Saltdogs had a near equal winning percentage against teams who finished with a better and worse record than them.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=SaltdogsScheduleV2, aes(x=Game, y=OppRank), size = 0.75, alpha=.4) +\n  geom_point(data=SaltdogsScheduleV2, aes(x=Game, y=OppRank, color=Result), size = 1.5, alpha= .75) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 6, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"#0C2340\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100)) +\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"W\" = \"green\", \"L\" = \"red\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  ylab(\"Record Rank in 2023\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=19, y=5.25), label=\"Saltdogs\\nRecord Rank\", color=\"#0C2340\", size=3.5) +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Mediocrity Did Not Discriminate\",\n    subtitle = \"Lincoln finished with nearly the same win percentage (48%) against teams with a better and worse record than them.\",\n    caption = \"Source: pointstreak.com | By Tyler Hurst\"\n  ) & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking into key batting and pitching statistical categories for the ’Dogs during the 2023 season, it becomes very apparent why Lincoln fell short of a playoff run.

It should come to a surprise to no one that they finished with a record of two games under .500, narrowly missing a shot for an impromptu 2023 American Association championship run"
