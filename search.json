    "text": "In 2018, Northwestern football completed the impossible. The nerds from Evanston won the Big Ten West and became the first team not named Wisconsin or Iowa to represent the division in the conference championship game, since the West (and East) division was established in 2014. From a statistical perspective, however, the 2018 rendition of the Wildcats appeared to be quite bad, finishing with the third-worst offensive yards per play and right below the middle of the pack when it comes to defensive yards given up per play in the Big Ten.  \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggbump)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nBigTenWest18v2 &lt;- read_csv(\"BigTenWest18v2.csv\")\nBigTenWest18Ydsv2 &lt;- read_csv(\"BigTenWest18Ydsv2.csv\")\nNorthwesternWinScoreDiff &lt;- read_csv(\"NorthwesternWinScoreDiff.csv\")\n\nBigTenWest18Ydsv2 |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalPlays = sum(OffPlays), \n    TotalYards = sum(OffYds), \n    DefensivePlays = sum(DefPlays), \n    DefensiveYards = sum(DefYds)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    OffensiveYPP = TotalYards/TotalPlays, \n    DefensiveYPP = DefensiveYards/DefensivePlays) -&gt; ypp\n\naverages &lt;- ypp |&gt; ungroup() |&gt; summarise(AvgOffYardsPer = mean(OffensiveYPP), AvgDefYardsPer = mean(DefensiveYPP))\n\nwest_teams &lt;- c(\"Northwestern\", \"Illinois\", \"Iowa\", \"Minnesota\", \"Nebraska\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Purdue\")\n\nwest &lt;- ypp |&gt; filter(Team %in% west_teams)\n\neast_teams &lt;- c(\"Ohio State\", \"Indiana\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan State\", \"Penn State\", \"Maryland\", \"Rutgers\")\n\neast &lt;- ypp |&gt; filter(Team %in% east_teams)\n\nteam_colors &lt;- c(\"Illinois\" = \"#E84A27\", \"Iowa\" = \"#FFCD00\", \"Minnesota\" = \"#7A0019\", \"Nebraska\" = \"#E41C38\", \"Northwestern\" = \"#4E2A84\", \"Purdue\" = \"#CEB888\", \"Wisconsin\" = \"#C5050C\")\n\n ggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=east, aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP), color=\"light grey\", size = 1.4) +\n  geom_point(data=west, aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=5.524939, color=\"dark grey\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept=5.726772, color=\"dark grey\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=6.25, y=5, label=\"Good Offense, Good Defense\"), color=\"#151515\", size = 2.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=4.75, y=5, label=\"Bad Offense, Good Defense\"), color=\"#151515\", size = 2.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=4.75, y=6.5, label=\"Bad Defense, Bad Offense\"), color=\"#151515\", size = 2.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=6.25, y=6.5, label=\"Bad Defense, Good Offense\"), color=\"#151515\", size = 2.5) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=west, aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label=Team, color=Team)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=east, aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label=Team, color=Team), size = 2.8) +\n  labs(x=\"Average Offensive Yards Per Play\", y=\"Average Defensive Yards Per Play\", title=\"Nothing to Write Home About Statistically...\", subtitle=\"Despite the title of Big Ten West divison champions, Northwestern ranked near the bottom\\nin offensive yards per play and sported a sub-par defense.\", caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Tyler Hurst\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = team_colors) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 7),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 6),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how did Northwestern win the division over multiple teams that ranked statistically better on both offense and defense? The Wildcats won when it mattered. Northwestern finished the season on a 7-1 record (their one loss to No. 3 Notre Dame), which included an undefeated 6-0 record against every divisional foe (outside of their win against Purdue that was played week one). \n\n\nCode\nnorthwestern_data &lt;- BigTenWest18v2 |&gt;\n  filter(Team == \"Northwestern\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=BigTenWest18v2, aes(x=Game, y=Wins, color=Team), alpha=.6) +\n  geom_point(data=BigTenWest18v2, aes(x=Game, y=Wins, color=Team), size = 3, alpha=.3) +\n  geom_point(data=northwestern_data, aes(x=Game, y=Wins, color=Team), size = 4) +\n  geom_bump(data=northwestern_data, aes(x=Game, y=Wins, color=Team), size = 1) +\n scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#E84A27\", \"#FFCD00\", \"#7A0019\", \"#E41C38\", \"#4E2A84\", \"#CEB888\", \"#C5050C\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2,4,6,8,10,12)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"How The West Was Won\",\n    subtitle = \"Northwestern football prevailed after a 1-3 start in 2018, closing the\\nseason on a 7-1 record.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Tyler Hurst\"\n  ) & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nMore specifically, the Wildcats were able to win one-possession games. When the mean score differential is calculated for the eight regular season wins for Northwestern in 2018, they won each game by an average of seven points. They only had three regular season wins in double digits, the most being by 14 points against No. 20 ranked Wisconsin at the time.  \n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=NorthwesternWinScoreDiff,\n    aes(y=reorder(Opponent, ScoreDiff), x=TeamPts, xend=OppPts),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Squeaking Out Wins\",\n    subtitle = \"The longer the line, the more points Northwestern won by in the regular season.\",\n    x = \"Points Scored (Red = Opponent, Green = Northwestern)\",\n    y = \"Opponent\",\n    caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Tyler Hurst\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the 2018 Northwestern Wildcats should be remembered as a gritty squad that was nothing statistically significant, but was able to win games when it mattered. Even though they could not bring home the Big Ten Championship against No. 6 Ohio State, they finished the year on a 31-20 victory over No. 20 Utah in the Holiday Bowl, cementing one of the most successful seasons in program history."
